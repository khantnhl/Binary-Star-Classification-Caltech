# Summer Research at Caltech: Low-Mass Stars and Binary Star Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data (not included due to file size), and results from my summer research at Caltech, where I focused on studying low-mass stars. Specifically, the research explored two main areas:

1. **Binary Star Classification**: I employed both machine learning (ML) and non-ML methods to classify binary star systems, aiming to improve classification accuracy and efficiency in identifying binary stars among low-mass star populations.

2. **Analysis of Old Single Fast Rotators**: I conducted a detailed analysis of bimodal distribution of rotational periods in low mass stars by seleecting old single fast-rotating stars to prove the binary hypothesis that says all the fast rotators are in binary system.

The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the properties and evolution of low-mass stars, which are crucial in the study of stellar and galactic evolution and in our search for habitable exoplanets.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **calculations**: Contains scripts for the mathematical and statistical analysis performed during the research. This includes both ML and non-ML approaches to binary star classification.
  
- **figures**: Includes all the plots, graphs, and visualizations generated during the research, illustrating the findings and comparisons of different methods used.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed step-by-step explanations of the experiments, data analysis, and results. This section includes both the ML and non-ML methodologies employed in binary star classification and the analysis of single fast rotators.

## Highlights

- **Machine Learning Methods**: I implemented various supervised learning algorithms to classify binary star systems based on their observed properties. I chose to use the Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier Neural Networks to solve the problem and achieved 73-75% accuracy with validation sets.

- **Non-Machine Learning Methods**: Traditional astrophysical techniques and statistical methods were applied to identify and classify binary star systems, providing a comparison to the ML approaches.
